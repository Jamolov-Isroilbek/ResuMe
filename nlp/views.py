# This file contains the AI Suggestions backend logic, prepared for modular updates.
# It uses OpenAI's GPT to generate explanations and modified resume sections, optionally based on job descriptions.
# It is structured around prompts.json configuration and can be reused for multiple AI tasks (e.g. one-click resume generation).
